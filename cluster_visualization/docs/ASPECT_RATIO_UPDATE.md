# Aspect Ratio Improvements - Summary

## ✅ Updated Cluster Visualization with Better Aspect Ratio Control

### What was changed:

1. **Enhanced Plot Layout**:
   - Increased default size from 800px to 900px height
   - Added width specification (1200px) for better proportions
   - Improved margins for better spacing
   - **Equal aspect ratio by default** (RA and Dec scales are proportional)

2. **New Interactive Controls**:
   - **Toggle Aspect Ratio**: Switch between equal and free aspect ratios
   - **Larger Plot** / **Smaller Plot**: Adjust height from 400px to 1200px
   - **Visual Status Indicator**: Shows current aspect ratio mode and plot size

3. **Improved Responsive Design**:
   - Better CSS layout with flexbox controls
   - More organized button layout
   - Visual feedback for current settings

### New Features in the HTML:

**Aspect Ratio Modes**:
- **Equal Aspect Ratio** (default): RA and Dec are proportionally scaled - better for accurate spatial representation
- **Free Aspect Ratio**: Plot stretches to fit available space - better for maximizing viewing area

**Size Controls**:
- **Dynamic height adjustment**: 400px to 1200px in 100px increments
- **Real-time updates**: Changes apply immediately
- **Status display**: Shows current height setting

### How to use:

1. **Generate the updated HTML**:
   ```bash
   python generate_standalone_html.py
   ```

2. **Serve with simple server**:
   ```bash
   python simple_server.py
   ```
   
3. **Use the new controls**:
   - Click "Toggle Aspect Ratio" to switch between proportional and stretched views
   - Click "Larger Plot" or "Smaller Plot" to adjust size
   - Status bar shows current settings

### Benefits:

✅ **Better spatial accuracy**: Equal aspect ratio shows true spatial relationships  
✅ **Flexible viewing**: Free aspect ratio maximizes screen usage  
✅ **Customizable size**: Adjust to your screen and preference  
✅ **Visual feedback**: Always know current settings  
✅ **Responsive design**: Works well on different screen sizes  

The updated visualization provides much better control over the aspect ratio and plot dimensions, solving the display issues you experienced with the Jupyter notebook.
